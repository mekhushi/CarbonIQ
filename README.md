🌱 CARBONIQ
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. With rising global temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and increasing carbon emissions, it has become more crucial than ever to take action—both individually and collectively. One of the most significant contributors to global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂), resulting from electricity usage, transportation, and industrial processes.
